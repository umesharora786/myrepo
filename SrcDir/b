Andrea Ristuccia's Monologue (Expanded Translation):
"You both don’t see it, do you? You have no idea what’s really going on, because you're too caught up in your own lives. Dad, you think everything's fine because you work a nice job, you bring home the money, and we live in a nice house. And Mom, you’re always trying to be the perfect wife, the perfect woman, always chasing something that doesn't even matter. But have you ever stopped to ask me what I want?
I’m not a part of your life! I’m just someone who happens to live in this house. You never ask how I’m feeling, you never ask what I’m thinking. You’re so busy pretending everything’s fine that you’ve forgotten I even exist. I’m standing right here in front of you, and you still can’t see me!
You’re selfish. Both of you. You care about your own problems, about your own dreams, but what about mine? You don’t even know what I’m going through. And I don’t need you to fix everything. I just wanted you to notice. To care. But now... I don’t need you at all. I’ve been doing this alone for so long, maybe it’s better this way. I’m tired of pretending I belong in this family when all I feel is... nothing. Nothing but being alone."

Step's Monologue (Translated from Italian):
"Do you know what it feels like to be stuck in a world where everything you do doesn’t matter? To be trapped in a life where you can’t escape from the expectations that others have of you? I’m tired of pretending to be someone I’m not. Tired of living up to everyone’s expectations, of being this tough guy that everyone thinks I am.
I don’t want to be this person anymore. I don’t want to keep fighting, to keep proving myself. All I want is to be with you, to be with someone who understands me, who sees me for who I really am. I’m tired of all this pretending, of all this anger. I just want to be real, to be honest.
But you don’t understand. You think you know what it’s like, but you don’t. You don’t see how hard it is for me to keep going, to keep pretending like everything’s okay. All I want is to find a place where I belong, where I can be myself without any of this pressure.
So maybe it’s better if we stay apart. Maybe it’s better if I keep my distance, if I keep my feelings to myself. Because right now, being with you feels like it’s just too hard, too complicated. And I don’t know if I can handle that right now."
